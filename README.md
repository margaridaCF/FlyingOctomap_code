# FlyingOctomap
An implementation of different algorithms over the octree implementation of octomap.

The code was developed with a test-driven process, that is why so far there are no nodes only tests.
Also, it is a work in progress. The separation of the interface and the implementation is on the roadmap.

Developed by M. Faria, in the context of MarineUAS program, Innovative Training Network in Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Systems for Marine and Costal Monitoring.
