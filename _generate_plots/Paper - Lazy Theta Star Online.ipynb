    "    **Yes**. When using a finer resolution it is apparent that one set of voxels that made the strutcture disapears to shitf to one side. This might be a precision problem because the RTK accuracy is only 0.9m or not if the accuracy of the RTK is only in respect to earth positioning and the diferencial between base and rover is always kept.\n",

    "2. Can the filters \n",
    "    1. Be simplified (**yes**) to improve performance (yes) \n",
    "    2. Incorporate a median filter to remove outliars. In order to reduce octomap divergence. - Median slows down. Replaced by a intensity filter combined with tweaked parameters of sensor_model/[hit|miss] for the octomap.\n"
